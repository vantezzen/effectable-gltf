<Intro>
  An extensible effects system for adding visual effects to glTF models in React
  Three Fiber.
</Intro>

## What is effectable-gltf?

effectable-gltf is designed to make it easy to add visual effects to your glTF models in React Three Fiber applications. It provides a component `ExtensibleGltf` that acts as a drop-in replacement for drei's `Gltf` component.

It provides two built-in effects:

1. **Overlay Effect**: Adds a color overlay to your model with customizable opacity
2. **Outline Effect**: Adds a cartoon-style outline to your model

You can create your own component, hooking into the Gltf meshes.

## Key Features

- **Drop-in Replacement**: Seamlessly replace `@react-three/drei`'s `Gltf` component with `EffectableGltf`
- **Built-in Effects**: Pre-built effects for common use cases
- **TypeScript Support**: Full type safety and autocompletion
- **React Three Fiber Integration**: Built on top of the powerful React Three Fiber ecosystem
